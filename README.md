![Swee Logo](./assets/logo.png)

Swee is a Chrome extension that enhances your Swiggy experience by allowing you to add notes to food items from various restaurants and track the delivery time in real-time. With Swee, you can make informed decisions about your future orders and stay updated on your delivery's progress.

## Features

### 1. Food Notes

Swee enables you to add personal notes to food items from different restaurants. This feature helps you keep track of which dishes you liked, disliked, or want to try again.

To use Food Notes:
1. [Install the Swee Chrome extension.](#installation)
2. Navigate to the Swiggy website and select a restaurant.
3. Against each food item, you should see a notes section, allowing you to view any existing notes and add new notes.
4. In the new note panel, you can enter and save notes for individual food items.
5. Further, in the Order Again section, you will also see an indicator informing you of any existing notes on the items, which when clicked, scrolls the page to the detailed food item section where you can view the note

**No data is shared with any server. Your notes are stored within your browser itself.**

### 2. Delivery Tracker

Swee provides a real-time delivery tracker that monitors the promised delivery time and the estimated delivery time. This feature helps you gauge if the delivery is on schedule or running behind.
